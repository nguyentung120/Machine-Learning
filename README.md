# Machine-Learning
Machine learning can serve as a solution to a variety of business complexities problems, and predict complex customer behaviors. We have also seen some of the major technology giants, such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc., coming up with their Cloud Machine Learning platforms
**Below are all my projects that use machine learning not only in business but also in hospital to visualize and build a prediction model with big data of organization**
